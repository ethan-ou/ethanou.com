The simplest way to describe Hugo:
Hugo is basically normal HTML and CSS, but with extra smarts tacked on.
All Hugo does is let you take out the repetitive parts of your website and repeat those parts again and again.
If you want a navigation bar across your website, you use hugo to take that part out, then insert it back into your webpage for every single page.
Instead of writing 5 nav bars for 5 pages, you write it once, then let Hugo do the linking for you.


index.html: Used for the front page. You know how normal front pages have lots and lots of content? Hugo lets you do exactly the same thing because at the end of the day, it's just smart HTML and CSS.

Let's look at a real world example:
