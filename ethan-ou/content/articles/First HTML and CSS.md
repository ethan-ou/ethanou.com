# Creating Your First Website Using HTML + CSS


The first thing you'll need to do is to open up Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on Mac.

Next, you'll want to add a line that tells the computer you're creating a HTML document.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

## How HTML works

To write HTML, you need to have an open angle bracket: ```<``` and a closing angle bracket with a backslash ```/>```. 
The computer looks through your text line by line, and whenever it sees an angle bracket it immediately thinks: HTML!



## Structuring the Page

The best way to think about website layouts is to look at everything as a box. The navigation bar on a website is a box. A blog post is a long box. A footer is a box.

Everything on a page, including irregular shapes, rounded buttons and funky images, are all boxes. 

To design a basic website, we simply need to combine common boxes together.

Let's take a look at some common websites to see how boxes translate into real websites.






To convert this sketch into HTML, we use the HTML tag known as a ```<div>```. A ```<div>``` is short for a divider, and it gives us neat boxes to use to layout our webpage.






When you first use a ```<div>``` on a webpage, it might be confusing. A ```<div>``` doesn't give you any visual feedback to say you're on the right track.


## What's the point in using HTML & CSS if I can do the same thing in X?
If you've come from a background where you've used Photoshop, or built websites visually with Squarespace, Wix or Wordpress, it may even come as a surprise that websites use these invisible elements to structure the page. 

It may also be a surprise to you that the web doesn't have any tools to help you design the whole page visually.

While I would agree that designing things visually leads to more creative results, there's a good reason why HTML and CSS are still used so widely today. Knowing these two technologies gives you incredible power to do things that visual editors can't do.

For instance, if you want to layout a website to look great on mobile and on desktop,
