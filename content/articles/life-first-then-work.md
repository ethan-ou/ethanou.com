If you're ever lost on what to do next, a simple, clarifying question that you can ask is: what's the point of this?

What's the point of learning new skills? What's the point of a better career? Why have kids?

If you follow any chain of questioning down to its bare essentials, you get the answer: "Because life is short, and I'll only have a couple of chances at most, to get this right."

If you think about everything that you'll want to do before you get older, it will be the things that everyone around you wants: To know what it's like to have a career, to have a child, to be really good at something, to have followed your curiosity until it gets to the end etc.

While accomplishing the things that broader society has told you is really quite nice, then it's also great to accomplish the things you really wanted to do. Things you know you'd regret if you didn't try.


What about goals you don't know about yet? What about things you'll only try when you've discovered the thing you want to do?

To this I say, start with the things you know you want right now. 

## Start with some version of your dreams

If your initial dream was large: say you wanted to be an airline pilot when you grew up, but your circumstances, education and other factors led you away from this path, it's not always the best idea to simply "follow your passion" without thinking about whether the dream is possible.

But all because you're not achieving the ideal version of your goal, doesn't mean you can't fulfil your dream. What you have to do instead however, is to fulfil *some version* of your dream.

This means, if you wanted to be an airline pilot, breaking down the parts of being an airline pilot and fulfilling the parts of being an airline pilot that you want. If your desire was simply to handle a plane in the air once in your life, go and 

This taste of your dreams might be what you wanted in the first place. The big dream might have pitfalls you didn't realise. Being a world-renouned musician comes with the cost of trying to appease record label executives, not seeing friends and family for months at a time, and playing the same songs again and again.

Being an airline pilot requires you to stay in other countries, where conditions might not be comfortable, and might force you to stay in a chair for hours on end.

By fulfilling *some part* of your dream, you keep yourself focused on the upside of your dream, without needing to encounter many of the downsides that come with turning that dream into a big thing.
