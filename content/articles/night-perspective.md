Recently, I stumbled into a way to gain some perspective if you're feeling lost, or want to reconnect with your core self.

It requires nothing fancy. You won't need to buy anything or travel someplace far away. Instead:

***

1. Wait until it's night.

2. Turn off all the lights.

3. Turn off your phone (or just put it on mute).

4. Sit down next to a window and listen. Listen to the world outside. Listen to the cars going past. Feel the breeze against your skin.

***

As you do this, you'll find your mind wandering towards thoughts and places that you don't think about during the day.

You start thinking about friends you haven't seen in a long time. Places you've still yet to explore. Past experiences and memories that were crucial turning points in your life.

You think about the future. Who you want to be; where you're going; and whether the forces of the outside world are moving you in a worthwhile direction.

You might also come to revelations that would be too raw to express in everyday life. Truths about the way you feel in your relationships. Truths about your feelings towards work, love and where you are in the grand scheme of things.

Experience these revelations as they come. Sit with them. Connect with them and the parts of you that have laid dormant while you've been busy out in the world.

Then once these revelations subside:

***

5. Write down the most important things you learnt on a piece of paper or on your phone.

***

Some key points:

- Write these realisations in 2nd person (e.g. "You believe X, Y, Z").

- Don't filter these thoughts. Write them in their raw and truthful state.

- You don't need to capture everything you learnt. Capture the most important 10%.

Once you're done with writing, sleep on it.

When you wake up the next day, take 5 minutes to reflect on what you learnt that night. Do the same when you're about to go to sleep.

And if you feel like there's more, turn off your lights again.
