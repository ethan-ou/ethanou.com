For the last five years, I'd had the idea of starting a blog. This week, I finally made that dream a reality.

In this article, I wanted to capture the story of the twists and turns, dead ends and varying technical choices I went through to make this blog real.

Even though this story could have been a few months long, life and my manic creative desires stretched this arc into a five year process. Despite this, I hope my story helps inspire you to start your own blog—even if it takes just as long to start it as I did.

## The First Attempt

Ever since I was a teenager, I'd been fascinated by writers. From [George Orwell's essays](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/) to [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), [Tim Urban](https://waitbutwhy.com/) and [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/), to [books by Alan Watts](https://www.amazon.com.au/Become-What-You-Alan-Watts/dp/1570629404) and the occasional opinion piece from [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/), my late teens were spent reading great non-fiction writers.

These books and essays affected me profoundly. And like many of the art forms I'd been inspired by, I wanted to try doing it myself.

One week in the summer of 2015, I made it happen. I set up an account on [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/)—the most straightforward website builder at the time, and spent a good portion of a month working on how the website looked. 

What I experienced in that month was constant frustration. The Web was complicated. Small tweaks could have drastic changes to the final output. I could spend hours trying to get something that looked simple (like a social media button) to work.

And while a couple of weeks later, I finally got the site looking right, I quickly stumbled into another challenge: what to write? I spent months with nothing on the blog, blocked on this seemingly minor problem.

By the time the ideas started flowing, it had been a year. Hosting the website through Squarespace costed $12AUD a month with $25AUD a year spent on keeping the domain name. That meant a total of $169AUD that year alone—equivalent to a month's worth of lunches as a student. It was a lot.

When the yearly renewal process came again, my mum (who had been paying for the website through her credit card) suggested we take the website down. It was a lot of money to be spending for essentially nothing she said. 

I agreed.  

For the next year, I wrote small articles on my hard drive whenever I had inspiration. They were generally self-help articles—personal experiences wrapped in theories explaining why things happened a certain way. But nothing really stuck. 

So after a year of struggle, I allowed the website idea and my writings to return back to the void. 

## Discovering Static Site Generators

By 2018, I'd been progressing through university and thinking about what skills I needed to be useful in a work setting. One of the skills that came up was Web development.  

In the past, I picked up skills as hobbies. I picked up filmmaking because I wanted to make videos. I picked up music because I wanted to recreate how songs made me feel.  

But Web development was a different beast. I picked it up because I wanted a skill that was useful to other people, not as something for enjoyment.  

I fought my way through [introductory courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), learning how to build basic websites before moving on to modern web development tools. I practiced those skills in small projects, open source contributions and even while working at a university.

It was in that period of my life where I learnt about [static site generators](https://jamstack.org/).

Since 2015, the Web had been slowly changing under my feet. The introduction of [new versions of JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) meant developers had great features to write complicated websites out of the box. [Front-end libraries](https://reactjs.org/) and [frameworks](https://vuejs.org/) gave way to web apps, making fully-fledged web applications possible for all.

And somewhere in those fields of innovation, the static site generator was gaining traction. 

See, up until the mid-2015s, most websites had to run on servers, since a live computer was required to generate pages of the site. This made maintaining websites a struggle. Anything from a crash on the server, to a viral article and even a targeted attack could bring the website down.

Static site generators on the other hand, allowed you to generate your website *before* putting it online. This meant you never needed to worry about server issues, or live website crashes. 

Even though adopting a static site generator was complicated to start with, it solved a lot of the problems I'd faced when trying to start my blog in 2015.  

For starters, hosting became a completely trivial problem. Static sites were so lean that [many hosting companies](https://www.netlify.com/) were able to [host your website for free](https://vercel.com/). No monthly subscription. No credit card. And the load times for your website were always blazing fast.

You also had the benefit of two technologies that worked in tandem: [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/) + [Github](https://github.com/). Markdown allowed you to write articles in a format that was simple for humans *and* computers to read, and when combined with git + Github, gave me the freedom to try new ideas, track changes and keep a full history of the site while using one of the most battle-hardened tools in software development.

Last but not least, static site generators forced me to commit to choices I could sustain for the next 5, 10 or 20 years. It made me think about the structure of the website, the ease of maintenance in the long-term and the technologies I wanted to go the distance with.  

Instead of viewing website building as simply repainting a house, I looked at the process as building the foundations for a skyscraper. As someone who was indecisive, creative and constantly changing their mind, this perspective helped stay the course, even when new ideas came along.

## Domain Name Troubles

While building the blog, I'd also looked at buying back my original domain name: [ethanou.com](https://www.ethanou.com). However, I noticed something surprising: the domain was already taken. I searched the domain registry for addresses, names or businesses and found a company in China that had acquired the domain when my website had gone off air.  

Soon, I found myself looking at a page full of Chinese advertising. This company was using the domain to increase traffic for their online ad campaigns. I searced around to see if I could do anything, but it turned out that ownership was locked until the owners wanted to pass on the domain. 

Since I wasn't in a rush, I figured I could just wait for the domain to expire. From my understanding, the website wasn't gaining a lot of traffic, so I calculated the domain would become a cost for this company that wouldn't be worth maintaining.

From the registry, I checked the expiry date: mid-September 2019, with a 30 day grace period for late renewals. If things worked out, by October or November 2019 the domain would be free again.  

So from March 2019, I waited. I continued working on the website offline in my free time. I worked on open source projects. Finished university. And every couple of months I checked to see how the domain was doing. 

Eventually, November 2019 rolled around. The ethanou.com domain was going to Chrome's dinosaur. Checking the registry confirmed my suspicions: the domain was free to purchase.

That day, I logged into [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/), searched for the URL and hit the buy button. An $18 AUD yearly subscription for as long as the internet, and my website desires could survive.  

What a bargain.

## The Present Day

A couple of iterations in styling, format and structuring later, this blog is now up and running. I'm finally starting to put ideas on the page. And this website is almost a year old at the time of writing, after pushing the unfinished version of the site live in November 2019.

Granted, I might change my mind and decide to pick up a website builder again like Wordpress, Squarespace or Webflow. I might decide to switch domains, or undergo an extensive rework of the site from the ground up.

But right now, I'm happy with where this website is. And I love the fact that I can walk away for three years, and nothing about this site will change.

Best of all, I can finally get down to the thing I was meant to do all along: share ideas.  

Here's to the next ten years of this blog!
