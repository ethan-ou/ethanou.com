title: The things no one has built yet

I'm going to make two major claims. 

The first: there have been a lot of tools made by programmers and companies that have been utilitarian in nature. What I mean by utilitarian is: something where the benefit comes from improving something practical: saving time, saving money, saving effort or making a certain task possible or more accessible.

Slack for instance, is a great tool for communicating for your team at work. 

The second: if you're a creator yourself, you want to be making something that's unique. You want to be working on something that no one has done properly, or succeeded in implementing. It may be simple to implement another chat feature, but companies have spent millions on making these tools and have already explored the problem more than you could ever do. 

To me, it's hard as a creator to make a unique tool that's utilitarian in nature. If it has saves someone large sums of money, or a lot of employee time, someone most likely has made it, funded it and developed it.

The way I see things however, there are large swaths of problems that haven't been explored yet. These problems are sometimes unsexy, and can't scale to multi-million dollar businesses. But for a solo creator or a small team, these are the problems that will allow you to create something no one has ever created before.

One way is by working inside of an industry that tech hasn't touched. Education, medicine, brick-and-mortar businesses and slow-moving bureaucracies are insulated from the latest and greatest tools that the technology industry has to offer. Take a tool that was built for another purpose, then repurpose it to use in another context.

Another way of building something new is by targeting a niche. Something so small, that no business ideas have ever come from it. Building timelapse photography software, or making an automatic podcast editing tool are examples of this.

But if you're not the type of person to build utilitarian products, I recommend another approach: focusing your energy on tools that remind people what's important in their life. Improve people's relationships, make them feel more mindful, and give them perspective on what matters.

Combine technology and the humanities, to influence people towards a better life.

Few companies have tread in this area, because making tools for life requires strong opinions. It requires an application of the soul, and a genuine interest in seeing whether your products will help others. These are not scalable qualities, and companies need to scale. But as a solo creator, this is an advantage. Staying small means you can build for a small crowd. You can focus on the values and principles you feel strongly about. You can integrate the latest scientific research, or advocate for an unconventional approach in your product. 

You can dare to be inventive, while still being helpful to others.
