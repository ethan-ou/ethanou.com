To be great at a certain skill is to be both interested and disinterested in it. You must have passion, for starters. You must be able to do the thing for the sake of it. But if you're only driven by passion, it's easy to get lost in things that don't matter. To have disinterest is to solve the problem at hand and avoid overcomplicating things. But too much, and you lose the care needed when things get more difficult.
