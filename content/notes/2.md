To be good at a skill is to be disinterested in it. If you have a passion for something, you'd do the thing for the sake of it, which makes it easy to get lost in rabbit holes. If you're disinterested, you do only what's necessary to solve the problem at hand. You treat the skill as a means to an end, which means you don't overcomplicate things and end up doing great work.
